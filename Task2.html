    <h3>Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript?</h3>
    <p>Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.</p>
